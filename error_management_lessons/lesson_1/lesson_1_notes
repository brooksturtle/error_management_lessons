The students will be required to make a list of each error they find, describe it, and how to solve it. They will be highly encouraged to google each error and find the solution on stack overflow.

Scaffolding: I made sure that all the errors were easily searchable and within the first three google search results, and they are some of the most common compiler java errors.
Finally the program will be tested for accuracy.

Current Knowledge: As they are first getting used to methods, 2-3 weeks into intro course. Knowledge of basic variable types, but before they get their first major programming assignment.

The only problem is that they may be overwhelmed with dealing with multiple errors at the same time. I would likely demonstrate in class how to do this.

Dialogue:
This lesson will be on how to look up errors. This program was made with 5-10 errors. If you come across an error, it will show the line number. Work on errors from first in the program to last.
For each error you fix, I want you to describe the error and what you did to solve it in a seperate doc. Search for anything you are unsure of. It should probably show up in the first few links.
Do example where you search for first error where the class is misnamed. If you search the whole error it comes up in the first stack overflow link.
